## Stock management
* Inventory or stock management
* Warehouse management
    * Warehouse managers are in a position to advise their inventory colleagures on
        * **levels of safty stock**
        * **the specific movements and characteristics of particular stock items**.
    * However, they tend to stop short of determining **stock levels**.
    * They are not involved directly in the **choice, purchase and replenishmet** of stock.
    * They can play a role in the identification of **fast-, medium-, slow-, non-moving and obsolete stock**.

**Stock classification**

Classification | Description | % of stock items
--- | --- | ---
A | Fast-moving stock | 20%
B | Medium-moving items | 35%
C1 | Slow-moving items
C2 | Very slow-moving but required for cover
O | Obsolete or non-moving stock
S | Special or one-off purchases
X | Non-stock or non-standard items

The goal is to identify the items in the C to X categories and act accordingly. Obsolete or non-moving stock needs to be analysed and one of the following tasks undertaken:
* return to seller if the contract allows;
* sell to staff at a discount;
* sell the item at a highly discounted rate either through normal channels or via companies who specialize in selling overstocks and obsolete items;
* assess whether it is cost effective to break the item down into its consituent parts;
* donate to charities; or
* dispose of the product as cheaply as possible. This may incure charges but it will release space to store other faster-moving product in its place.

A quick and easy way to ascertaining whether there is an excess of slowmoving stock in the warehouse is to calculate the stock turn:

```
    Stock turn = cost of goods sold / average cost of goods stored
or:
    Annual throughput in units / average number of units held in stock
```

## Stock or inventory counting

All warehouses are obligated to undertake some form of stock count.

It depends on **the law of the country** and **accounting requirements** as to how frequent and comprehensive the count is.

A move towards **cycle counting** or **perpetual inventory counts** as a replacement for an all-encompassing annual count of stock in the warehouse.

=> ensure a comprehensive count:
* 8 per cent of A items counted weekly (ensures each SKU is counted approsimately once per quarter);
* 4 per cent of B items counted weekly (counted twice per annum); and
* 2 per cent of C items counted weekly (counted at least once per annum).

* Each discrepancy needs to be investigated and procedures put in place to ensure that there is no repeat of the problem.
* The trade-off here is the cost of the error against the cost of discovering it in the first place.

## The count it itself

* All stock counts require organizing
    * Who will undertake the stock count
    * What you are planning to count
    * When you plan to undertake the stock count
    * What tools and equipment you need and the timescale allotted

* Prior to the start of the count ensure that all items have been put away in their correct location and try to despatch as many items as possible prior to the stock take.
