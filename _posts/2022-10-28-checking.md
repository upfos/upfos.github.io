## Packing - pieces/items/eaches

Once product has been picked there is the question of how it is packaged for despatch. As previously discussed, with individual order picks the operator may well package the product immediately, attach **shipping labels** and where required insert despatch documentation and invoices.

This reduces **the number of touch points** in the warehouse but does take the operator away from the prime task of picking.

Where there is the possibility of damage in transit, material can be added to the carton such as polystyrene and foam pellets, shredded paper, corrugated paper, air-filled bags, etc. 

**Carton**

**Polystyrene**

This again increases time at despatch and puts the onus on the customer to dispose of the **excess packaging** on receipt.
