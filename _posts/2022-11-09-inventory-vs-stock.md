> 本篇內容來自於 [oneviewcommerce.com](https://oneviewcommerce.com/blog/inventory-vs-stock)。

Stock is the supply of finished goods available for sale, and inventory includes both finished goods and components that create a finished product. In other words, **all stock is inventory, but not all inventory is stock.**

## The Definitions

Inventory | Stock
--- | ---
Refers to the value of parts and raw material used for manufacturing, work in process goods, and the final product | refers to the value of all items that are available and directly sold to the customers
Helps you arrive at the sale price of the stock | Helps you determine business revenue
Needs to be updated and managed on a quarterly or yearly basis (end of accounting period) | Needs to be updated and managed on daily (maybe even multiple times a day)
Term used in both retail and manufacturing | More common in production and manufacturing
Arrive at the value of inventory using methods, such as FIFO, LIFO, and weighted average methods | Value of stock is based on the current market value or the price at which goods are sold to the customer

## The Differences

Inventory | Stock
--- | ---
Inventory management is much more complex and dynamic, since it has accounting and equity implications | Stock is related to customers and suppliers, involving administrative issues, cash flows, strategies, and marketing and sales management
Inventory is closely linked to a company's warehouse operational cycles, in addition to control of existing items, damage and loss, and replacement——in other words, logistics flows | Stock includes everything that is for sale, while inventory includes all assets comprising the company's assets
